So how the code works is that
first it takes the footage from the path

then it uses yolo8 small model to detect the things around

so here we have given a list of objects names which we use to compare with yolo's detected 
and then by using cv zone we have made a rectangle around the detected objects

then using if else statements we have only targeted specific vechicles to be detected and show it

then we have masked the unwanted areas as by just layiring it over the footage

then we use a coustom sorting tracking program from git hub to track the trageted objected so as to count it

now we have used a list to track the ids of the detected vechicles

then we have placed a virtual line where when the point of the tracted object touches it gets counted

we have used cuda software for using GPU for better performance
